On July 15th, BZONE got a Cardano Foundation delegation of 15.1M along an "outstanding contribution" mention! Very thankful to the Cardano Foundation for supporting the developers community who are building the ecosystem on the platform. Let's hope that with this delegation our pool gets the push it needs to bring new delegators to support our developments. Please consider staking with us too, small pools really need of your support and it's important to support single pool operators as a way to ensure decentralisation.

Cardano Foundation delegations are rounds of a certain amount of ADAs (around 15M) that are rotating every 3 months, destined to small stake pools run by people who build what the community needs, create open-source solutions, and help the ecosystem thrive.
