          <h3>How to Stake ADA</h3>
          <p> In order to stake ADA you will need to:</p>
            <ol class="staking-steps">
              <li>
                <div><span>Own ADA:</span> Most people buy ADA through exchanges like <a href="https://www.binance.com/" target="_blank">Binance</a> or <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/" target="_blank">Coindesk</a>. You can also get ADA by changing other cryptos from Exodus wallet.   
              </div></li>
              <li>
                <div><span>Install one of the official Cardano wallets:</span> <a href="https://daedaluswallet.io/" target="_blank">Daedalus</a> or Yoroi (<a href="https://yoroi-wallet.com/" target="_blank">Desktop</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emurgos-yoroi-cardano-wallet/id1447326389" target="_blank">Iphone</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emurgo" target="_blank">Android</a>). We recommend Yoroi because it's a light wallet, easy to setup and multi-platform.</div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <div><span>Create a wallet:</span> Follow the instructions on your wallet software to create a wallet, be sure to store the recovery phrase/words in a safe place, best practice it’s to write it down by hand, never save it on a place that can be accessed by an attacker who finds out your password, since with these words all your ADA can be stolen.</div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <div><span>Fund your wallet:</span> Now you can send your ADA from the exchange you bought them to your new wallet. Copy the "receiving address" exactly as shown in Yoroi/Daedalus and register a Cardano withdrawal address in your exchange account.</div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <div><span>Stake your ADA:</span> Once you've received your ADA, you can create the delegation to start staking ADA, chose the steps below according to your wallet:</div>
              </li>
